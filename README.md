# Bikesharing: The Cycle

## Overview of the Analysis

We would like to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. The information below is our bike trip analysis.

### In the analysis we will:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week

## Results

### Checkout times for users

The majority of users check out between the first twenty minutes. This information tell us that the system would need to invest in high quantity if bikes to cover the demand. On the other hand, it could result in less repairs as trips are short.

### Checkout times by Gender

Males are our primary users. They have similar use patterns to our other female and other categories, but the vast majority of our income is from males on less than 20 minute rides.

### Trips by Weekday

We see a general pattern for use at 8am & 5pm. We would likely attribute this to the work day. There is some increase during the weekends during the middle of the day.

### User trips by Gender by Weekday

The information here shows gender graphics. The information is somewhat similar between genders, therefore this chart is not as powerful. It is a good check though!

### Bike Utilization

Bike utilization could potentially be one of the more useful graphs. We can spot high use bikes and tie reasons to _why_ the bike is heavily used. We can also rotate our bikes if the specified bike happends to be in a high use area. We will certainly want to maintain the bikes with high use.

### Top Ending Locations

The Bike Utilization and Top Ending Locations can tied together. We will want to tie the ending location to high use bikes for maintenance vehicles. We can identify the needed changes, send the locations to the drivers, and rotate bikes for maintenance.
