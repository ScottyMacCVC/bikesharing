# Bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis

We would like to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. The information below is our bike trip analysis.

### In the analysis we will:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week

## Results

The majority of users check out between the first twenty minutes. This information tell us that the system would need to invest in high quantity if bikes to cover the demand. On the other hand, it could result in less repairs as trips are short.

### Checkout times for users

Males are our primary users. They have similar use patterns to our other female and other categories, but the vast majority of our income is from males on less than 20 minute rides. 

### Checkout times by Gender

We see a general pattern for use at 8am & 5pm. We would likely attribute this to the work day. There is some increase during the weekends during the middle of the day.
